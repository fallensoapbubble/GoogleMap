# 1. Base image: Node 20 LTS (slim version)
FROM node:20-slim


# 2. Set working directory inside container
#Every command that follows happens inside the /app folder in the container.
WORKDIR /app


# 3. Copy package manifest and install dependencies first
#This copies only the package manifest files (which list your dependencies) from your project folder into the /app directory inside the container (remember, thanks to WORKDIR /app, this is your base).

# Why just these files? So you can install dependencies before copying the rest of the source code. This improves Docker layer caching, making rebuilds faster!
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./

# npm ci (short for clean install) installs exactly the dependencies listed in package-lock.json. It’s faster and more predictable than npm install, especially in CI/CD pipelines.

# --omit=dev tells npm to skip development dependencies—great for production containers that don’t need things like testing tools or linters.
RUN npm ci --omit=dev

# 4. Copy the rest of your source code
COPY . .


# 5. Expose port your server listens on
EXPOSE 4000


# 6. Define default start command
CMD ["node", "index.js"]
