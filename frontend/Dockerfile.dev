# 1. Build stage: use Node to bundle
# means you're giving a name to this stage of the Docker build processâ€”you're calling it builder.

#  Why Name a Build Stage?
# Naming a stage allows you to reference it later in the Dockerfile. So if you only want to copy the built files from this stage, you can use that name like this:
FROM node:20-slim AS builder

# This sets /app as the working directory inside the container.
# All commands that follow (like copying files, installing dependencies, compiling code) happen inside this folder.
WORKDIR /app

# Install deps
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm ci

# Copy the rest of the code
COPY . .

# 2. Serve stage: use lightweight web server
# Expose Vite's default dev port
EXPOSE 5173

# Start Vite dev server
CMD ["npm", "run", "dev", "--", "--host"]
